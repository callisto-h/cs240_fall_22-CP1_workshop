Hey!

There's a memory leak in this program. That means that some of the memory on the heap that
we grab with 'new' doesn't get returned with 'delete'.

The basic structure of this program is a Top object has an array of Middle objects which have arrays
of Bottom objects which have arrays of ints.

Like so:

Top[
    Middle[
        Bottom[
            int, int, int
        ]
        Bottom[
            int, int, int
            ]
    ]
    Middle[
        Bottom[
            int, int, int
        ]
        Bottom[
            int, int, int
            ]
    ]
]

Make and run the exe to see what I mean. To verify the memory leaks, run "valgrind ./executable.exe".
